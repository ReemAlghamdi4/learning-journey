# Learning Journey

An iOS app to help users track daily progress, manage learning streaks, and stay accountable for their goals.

## Description

Learning Journey is designed for anyone who wants to build a consistent learning habit. It tackles the challenge of staying motivated by providing a clear visual tracker for your goals.
The app helps you stay accountable by managing 'freeze' days for breaks and tracking your learning streak, which resets after 32 hours of no activity.

## ✨ Features

-   **Goal Setting:** Set custom learning goals with weekly, monthly, or yearly durations.
-   **Daily Logging:** Log daily progress as "Learned" or "Freeze" to maintain your streak.
-   **Streak Management:** Your streak automatically tracks your consistency. It resets after 32 hours of inactivity to keep you on track.
-   **Freeze Day System:** The app provides a limited number of "freeze" days based on your goal duration (2 per week, 8 per month, 98 per year) to allow for flexible breaks without losing your progress.
-   **Calendar View:** Visualize your entire journey with a comprehensive calendar that shows all your 'Learned' and 'Freeze' days.
-   **Goal Editing:** Easily edit your goal at any time using the edit icon.
